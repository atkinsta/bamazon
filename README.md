# Bamazon
## Homework 10, a CLI that simulates an online store.

This CLI which uses Inquirer, MySQL, and Node simulates an online store. Customers can see all items or search by department. They can then select an item to purchase and it will give them their total. 

Managers can easily manage the store. They are able to view all items currently being sold, check which items have fewer than 10 in stock, add items to the stock, and add a new product completely. Below are some examples of this CLI working.
